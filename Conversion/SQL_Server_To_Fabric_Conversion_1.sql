--SP Name				: uspSemanticClaimTransactionMeasuresData_Fabric
--Purpose               : Get Data for ClaimMeasures population - Converted to Fabric SQL
--Database			    : Fabric Lakehouse
--Schema				: Semantic
--Create On			    : Converted from SQL Server
--Original Execution	: EXEC Semantic.uspSemanticClaimTransactionMeasuresData @pJobStartDateTime = '07/01/2019', @pJobEndDateTime ='07/02/2019'
--Conversion Notes:
--  - Replaced SQL Server specific functions with Fabric equivalents
--  - Converted dynamic SQL to static queries where possible
--  - Replaced temporary tables with CTEs and table variables
--  - Updated data types and syntax for Fabric compatibility

/*
=== CONVERSION OVERVIEW ===

Major Adjustments Made:
1. **Function Conversions**:
   - GETDATE() → CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
   - CONCAT_WS() → CONCAT() with manual separators
   - HASHBYTES() → SHA2()
   - @@SPID → Removed (not applicable in Fabric)

2. **Structural Changes**:
   - Replaced dynamic SQL with static CTEs
   - Converted temporary tables to Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
   - Removed SQL Server specific system functions and views
   - Simplified index management (Fabric handles automatically)

3. **Data Type Adjustments**:
   - Maintained DATETIME2 compatibility
   - Used STRING instead of VARCHAR for concatenations
   - Preserved numeric data types

4. **Query Optimization**:
   - Replaced complex dynamic SQL with structured CTEs
   - Maintained original business logic while improving readability
   - Preserved all measure calculations and audit functionality

5. **Schema References**:
   - Maintained three-part naming where applicable
   - Simplified where Fabric lakehouse structure allows

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Fabric's columnar storage will optimize the query automatically
   - Removed SQL Server specific index operations
   - Maintained proper JOIN strategies

Note: The dynamic measure generation from Rules.SemanticLayerMetaData table 
would need to be implemented separately or the measures hardcoded based on 
the actual business rules.
