# SQL Server To Fabric Migration Plan - Employee Backup Refresh Script

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive migration plan for converting the Employee Backup Refresh SQL Server script to Microsoft Fabric, including detailed cost estimations and testing effort requirements. The script implements a production-ready routine to create point-in-time backups of Employee master datasets with integrated salary information.

**Migration Scope:**
- Source: SQL Server 2019-2022 Employee Backup Script
- Target: Microsoft Fabric SQL Analytics Endpoint
- Data Volume: ~2.7 TB total (Employee: 2 TB, Salary: 500 GB, Backup Output: 200 GB)
- Complexity Level: Low-Medium (25/100 complexity score)

## 2. Source System Analysis

### 2.1 Current SQL Server Script Overview

**Script Purpose:** Production-ready routine to create and maintain point-in-time backup of Employee master dataset

**Key Components:**
- **Tables Involved:** 3 tables (dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary, dbo.employee_bkup)
- **Operations:** DDL (CREATE/DROP TABLE), DML (INSERT/SELECT), Error Handling
- **Data Flow:** INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables
- **Business Logic:** Conditional table creation/deletion based on data availability

**Current Data Volumes:**
- Employee Table: ~2 TB
- Salary Table: ~500 GB
- Employee Backup Output: ~200 GB (processed result)
- Processing Volume: ~250 GB (10% of source data actively processed)

### 2.2 Complexity Analysis

| Metric | Count | Impact Level |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Lines of Code | 95 | Low |
| Tables Used | 3 | Low |
| Joins | 1 (INNER JOIN) | Low |
| Conditional Logic | 3 (IF statements) | Low |
| DML Statements | 8 | Medium |
| SQL Server Specific Features | 9 | High |
| **Overall Complexity** | **25/100** | **Low-Medium** |

## 3. Fabric Migration Requirements

### 3.1 Syntax Compatibility Analysis

**SQL Server Features Requiring Modification:**

| Feature | Current Usage | Fabric Compatibility | Required Action |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| OBJECT_ID() | Table existence check | ❌ Not Supported | Replace with INFORMATION_SCHEMA |
| TRY-CATCH blocks | Error handling | ❌ Not Supported | Replace with conditional logic |
| XACT_STATE() | Transaction state | ❌ Not Supported | Remove/replace |
| THROW statement | Error propagation | ❌ Not Supported | Replace with alternative |
| CHAR(n) data type | Column definition | ⚠️ Limited Support | Convert to VARCHAR/STRING |
| SET NOCOUNT ON | Session setting | ❌ Not Supported | Remove |
| GO statements | Batch separator | ❌ Not Supported | Remove |
| ROLLBACK | Transaction control | ⚠️ Limited Support | Review implementation |
| SMALLINT | Data type | ✅ Supported | No change needed |

**Total Syntax Differences:** 9 major incompatibilities requiring manual intervention

### 3.2 Fabric-Optimized Code Structure

**Recommended Fabric Implementation:**
```sql
-- Fabric-optimized Employee Backup Script
IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
           WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dbo' AND TABLE_NAME = 'employee_bkup')
BEGIN
    DROP TABLE dbo.employee_bkup;
END

IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.Employee)
BEGIN
    CREATE TABLE dbo.employee_bkup
    WITH (
        CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
        DISTRIBUTION = HASH(EmployeeNo)
    )
    AS
    SELECT  
        e.EmployeeNo,
        CAST(e.FirstName AS VARCHAR(30)) AS FirstName,
        CAST(e.LastName AS VARCHAR(30)) AS LastName,
        e.DepartmentNo,
        CAST(s.NetPay AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS NetPay
    FROM dbo.Employee e
    INNER JOIN dbo.Salary s ON e.EmployeeNo = s.EmployeeNo
    OPTION (LABEL = 'Employee_Backup_Creation');
    
    UPDATE STATISTICS dbo.employee_bkup;
END
```
