# Cost and Testing Effort Estimation for SQL Server to Fabric Migration

## 1. Cost Estimation

### 1.1 Microsoft Fabric Compute Resources

| Resource Type | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total Cost |
|--------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Enterprise DBU | 24 hours | $0.55/hour | $13.20/day |

### 1.2 Data Volume and Processing Costs

| Data Category | Volume | Processing Frequency | Monthly Cost |
|--------------|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| Base Tables | 5.1 TB | Daily | $396.00 |
| Processed Data (~10%) | 650 GB | Daily | $107.25 |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | | | **$503.25** |

### 1.3 Cost Breakdown by Component

| Component | Cost Percentage | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Data Storage | 15% | $75.49 |
| Compute Processing | 65% | $327.11 |
| Memory Usage | 20% | $100.65 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$503.25** |

### 1.4 Cost Estimation Rationale

1. **High Data Volume Processing**: The procedure processes multiple large tables (1+ TB) with complex joins and transformations.

2. **Dynamic SQL Generation**: The dynamic generation of measure calculations requires additional compute resources for parsing and execution.

3. **Complex Transformations**: Multiple financial calculations across different claim types increase the computational complexity.

4. **Hash Value Generation**: The SHA2_512 hash generation for change detection is computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.

5. **Multiple Joins**: The procedure performs 7+ joins between large tables, requiring significant memory and compute resources.

6. **Temporary Data Storage**: The creation and manipulation of multiple temporary tables adds to the storage and I/O costs.

## 2. Code Fixing and Testing Effort Estimation

### 2.1 Manual Code Fixing Effort

| Task | Complexity | Effort (Hours) | Justification |
|------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Global Temporary Table Conversion | High | 16 | Convert 5 global temporary tables to Spark DataFrames or Delta tables |
| Dynamic SQL Rewrite | High | 24 | Rewrite dynamic SQL generation using Python/Scala string interpolation |
| Hash Function Replacement | Medium | 8 | Replace SQL Server HASHBYTES with Spark hash functions |
| Index Management Conversion | Medium | 12 | Replace SQL Server index management with Delta Lake optimizations |
| System Variable Replacement | Medium | 6 | Replace SQL Server system variables with Spark equivalents |
| Transaction Handling | Low | 4 | Implement appropriate transaction handling in Spark |
| **Total Manual Code Fixing** | | **70 hours** | |

### 2.2 Output Validation Effort

| Task | Complexity | Effort (Hours) | Justification |
|------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| Test Case Development | High | 20 | Create comprehensive test cases for all financial calculations |
| Data Preparation | Medium | 12 | Prepare test datasets for validation |
| Execution and Comparison | High | 24 | Execute both SQL Server and Fabric code and compare results |
| Discrepancy Analysis | High | 16 | Analyze and resolve any discrepancies in results |
| Performance Testing | Medium | 12 | Validate performance metrics against requirements |
| Documentation | Medium | 8 | Document testing process and results |
| **Total Output Validation** | | **92 hours** | |

### 2.3 Total Estimated Effort

| Category | Effort (Hours) |
|----------|----------------|
| Manual Code Fixing | 70 |
| Output Validation | 92 |
| **Total Effort** | **162 hours** |

### 2.4 Effort Estimation Rationale

1. **Complex Code Structure**: The stored procedure has a complex structure with multiple phases and dependencies, requiring careful analysis and conversion.

2. **Dynamic SQL Generation**: The dynamic generation of measure calculations is particularly challenging to convert to Spark equivalents.

3. **Temporary Table Usage**: Heavy reliance on temporary tables requires redesigning the data flow using Spark DataFrames or Delta tables.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Significant effort is needed to ensure the Fabric implementation maintains or improves performance compared to SQL Server.

5. **Financial Calculations**: The procedure performs numerous financial calculations that must be validated for accuracy after conversion.

6. **Change Detection Logic**: The hash-based change detection mechanism needs careful conversion to maintain data integrity.

7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling must be implemented to replace SQL Server's transaction management.

## 3. Additional Considerations

1. **Incremental Processing Strategy**: The current SQL Server implementation uses date-based incremental processing. This approach needs to be adapted for Fabric using Delta Lake's Change Data Feed or watermark-based processing.

2. **Security Implementation**: Row-level and column-level security configurations need to be migrated from SQL Server to Fabric's security model.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Additional effort may be required to implement comprehensive logging and monitoring in Fabric.

4. **Performance Tuning**: After initial implementation, performance tuning may be necessary to optimize the Fabric code for large-scale data processing.

5. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation should be created to facilitate knowledge transfer and future maintenance.
