Description: Production-ready SQL Server routine to (re)create a point-in-time backup of the Employee master dataset by joining Employee and Salary tables, ensuring data integrity and backup consistency.
=============================================

1. Complexity Metrics

- Number of Lines: ~65
- Tables Used: 3 (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup)
- Joins: 1 INNER JOIN (between Employee and Salary on EmployeeNo)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Temporary Tables: 0 (None used)
- Aggregate Functions: 0 (No COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, or window functions)
- DML Statements: 4 (SELECT, INSERT, DROP, CREATE)
- Conditional Logic: 4 (IF EXISTS, IF OBJECT_ID, BEGIN...END, TRY...CATCH)
- Complexity Score: 35/100
  - Moderate complexity due to use of error handling, conditional logic, and DDL/DML operations.
  - No recursive CTEs, window functions, or procedural logic.
  - No expensive operations like CROSS JOIN or correlated subqueries.
  - No nested queries or dynamic SQL execution.
  - High-complexity areas: None present; logic is straightforward and routine.

2. Syntax Analysis

- SQL Server-specific syntax patterns identified:
  - TRY...CATCH error handling block for robust error management.
  - IF EXISTS and IF OBJECT_ID for conditional DDL execution.
  - DDL statements: DROP TABLE, CREATE TABLE.
  - DML statements: INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... INNER JOIN.
  - No use of CTEs, derived tables, string aggregation functions, or window/ranking functions.
  - No dynamic SQL or non-standard SQL Server functions present.
  - No use of temporary tables, table variables, or advanced JSON/XML functions.

3. Manual Adjustments

- Function optimizations:
  - No expensive expressions present; join uses primary key for efficiency.
- Syntax adjustments for performance:
  - Ensure indexes exist on Employee.EmployeeNo and Salary.EmployeeNo for optimal join performance.
  - Consider adding a unique constraint or primary key to employee_bkup.EmployeeNo if not present.
- Query structure and execution optimizations:
  - No cursors or nested subqueries; set-based logic is already used.
  - No need for indexed views due to simplicity of join.
  - No nested subqueries; join is direct and efficient.
  - Error handling is robust with TRY...CATCH and THROW.

4. Optimization Techniques

- Indexing optimizations:
  - Ensure Employee.EmployeeNo and Salary.EmployeeNo are indexed (preferably as primary keys).
  - Consider a clustered index on employee_bkup.EmployeeNo for backup table performance.
- Partitioning strategies:
  - Not required for small to moderate datasets; consider table partitioning for very large Employee or Salary tables.
- Table Variables vs. Temporary Tables:
  - Not applicable; no temporary storage used.
- Query Execution Plan analysis:
  - Review execution plan to confirm index usage on join columns.
  - Ensure no table scans occur on large tables.
- Reducing unnecessary I/O and improving memory usage:
  - Only employees with matching salary records are included, reducing data volume.
  - Minimal row locking due to short transaction scope and set-based operations.
