# SQL Server to Fabric Conversion Review

## 1. Summary

The `uspSemanticClaimTransactionMeasuresData` stored procedure is a complex data processing routine designed to retrieve and process semantic claim transaction measures data for ClaimMeasures population. This procedure involves sophisticated ETL operations including dynamic SQL generation, temporary table management with session-specific naming, hash-based change detection, and complex data transformations.

The conversion to Microsoft Fabric requires a fundamental architectural shift from traditional T-SQL stored procedures to Fabric's Spark SQL-based environment. This review document identifies key conversion challenges and provides specific recommendations for a successful migration while maintaining functionality, performance, and data integrity.

The procedure's primary purpose is to process claim transaction data, apply business rules from the Rules.SemanticLayerMetaData table, and populate the Semantic.ClaimTransactionMeasures table with calculated measures. It handles complex logic for identifying new and changed records using hash values and manages various recovery types and financial calculations.

| Subqueries | ✅ High | Compatible syntax | Direct conversion |
| CASE expressions | ✅ High | Direct conversion | Direct conversion |
| String functions | ⚠️ Medium | Some functions may have different names or parameters | Function mapping required |
| Date functions | ⚠️ Medium | GETDATE() → CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Function mapping required |
| Variable declarations | ❌ Low | DECLARE not supported in same way | Complete redesign required |
| Procedural logic | ❌ Low | BEGIN/END blocks not supported | Algorithmic redesign required |
| Dynamic SQL execution | ❌ Low | sp_executesql not available | Complete redesign required |
