# Documentation for Stored Procedure: uspSemanticClaimTransactionMeasuresData

## 1. Overview of Program

### Purpose
The stored procedure `uspSemanticClaimTransactionMeasuresData` is designed to extract, transform, and load data for claim transaction measures population in the Semantic layer. It processes claim transaction data from source systems, applies business rules and transformations, and prepares the data for analytical consumption. The procedure specifically focuses on workers' compensation (WC) claims data, as indicated by the table names and field references throughout the code.

**Fabric Migration Note**: This procedure is designed for migration to Microsoft Fabric, requiring transformation from SQL Server stored procedure to Fabric notebook or pipeline architecture.

### Enterprise Data Warehousing Alignment
This implementation aligns with enterprise data warehousing principles by:
- Implementing a semantic layer that translates raw data into business-meaningful metrics
- Supporting data integration from multiple source systems
- Providing consistent calculation of claim transaction measures
- Enabling efficient data access for reporting and analytics
- Implementing change data capture techniques for efficient processing
- Supporting incremental data loads based on date parameters

**Fabric Enhancement**: In Fabric, this aligns with lakehouse architecture, enabling real-time analytics and improved scalability through distributed processing.

### Business Problem Addressed
The procedure addresses the business need for standardized claim transaction metrics that can be used for:
- Financial reporting and analysis of workers' compensation claims data
- Tracking of paid and incurred amounts across different claim categories
- Monitoring recovery amounts by various recovery types (subrogation, deductible, etc.)
- Supporting claim analytics and business intelligence
- Providing consistent metrics for risk assessment and underwriting

### Benefits
- Consistent calculation of claim metrics across the organization
- Improved data quality through standardized transformations
- Enhanced performance for claim transaction reporting
- Support for historical analysis through effective dating
- Efficient processing through change detection and incremental loads
- Comprehensive tracking of various financial aspects of claims

**Fabric Benefits**: Enhanced scalability, real-time processing capabilities, and integration with Power BI for advanced analytics.
