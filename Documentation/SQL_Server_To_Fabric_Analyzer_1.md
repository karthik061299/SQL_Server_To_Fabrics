| **Number of Lines** | 95 | Total lines including comments and whitespace |
| **Tables Used** | 3 | Employee (source), Salary (source), employee_bkup (target) |
| **Joins** | 1 | 1 INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables |
| **Temporary Tables** | 0 | No temporary tables used |
| **Aggregate Functions** | 0 | No aggregate functions present |
| **DML Statements** | 8 | SELECT: 3, INSERT: 1, CREATE: 2, DROP: 2 |

| **Functions Used** | 3 | OBJECT_ID(), EXISTS(), XACT_STATE() |
| **Subqueries** | 1 | EXISTS subquery for conditional logic |

### Complexity Score: **25/100** (Low Complexity)

**Rationale:**
- Simple table operations with basic DDL/DML
- Minimal join complexity (single INNER JOIN)
- No advanced SQL Server features like window functions or CTEs
- Straightforward error handling pattern
- Limited conditional logic

## 2. Syntax Analysis

### SQL Server Specific Features Identified

| Feature | Usage | Fabric Compatibility | Action Required |
|---------|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| **OBJECT_ID()** | Table existence check | ❌ Not supported | Replace with INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries |
| **SET NOCOUNT ON** | Suppress row count messages | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **TRY-CATCH** | Error handling | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **XACT_STATE()** | Transaction state check | ❌ Limited support | Replace with alternative error handling |
| **THROW** | Error re-raising | ❌ Not supported | Replace with RAISE_ERROR or custom handling |
| **CHAR(n)** | Fixed-length strings | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **SMALLINT** | Data type | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | Constraint | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **INNER JOIN** | Join type | ✅ Supported | No change needed |
| **IF EXISTS** | Conditional logic | ✅ Supported | No change needed |

### Syntax Differences Count: **3 Major Differences**

1. **OBJECT_ID() function** - Not available in Fabric
2. **XACT_STATE() function** - Limited support in Fabric
3. **THROW statement** - Not supported in Fabric

## 3. Manual Adjustments

### High Priority Adjustments

#### 1. Replace OBJECT_ID() Function
**Current Code:**
```sql
IF OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.employee_bkup', N'U') IS NOT NULL
    DROP TABLE dbo.employee_bkup;
```

**Fabric Equivalent:**
```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES 
           WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'dbo' AND TABLE_NAME = 'employee_bkup')
    DROP TABLE dbo.employee_bkup;
```

#### 2. Replace XACT_STATE() and THROW
**Current Code:**
```sql
BEGIN CATCH
    IF XACT_STATE() = -1 ROLLBACK;
    THROW;
END CATCH
```

**Fabric Equivalent:**
```sql
BEGIN CATCH
    IF @@TRANCOUNT > 0 ROLLBACK;
    DECLARE @ErrorMessage NVARCHAR(4000) = ERROR_MESSAGE();
    DECLARE @ErrorSeverity INT = ERROR_SEVERITY();
    DECLARE @ErrorState INT = ERROR_STATE();
    RAISERROR(@ErrorMessage, @ErrorSeverity, @ErrorState);
END CATCH
```

### Medium Priority Adjustments

#### 3. Data Type Optimization
**Current:**
```sql
FirstName    CHAR(30)    NOT NULL,
LastName     CHAR(30)    NOT NULL,
```

**Fabric Optimized:**
```sql
FirstName    VARCHAR(30)    NOT NULL,
LastName     VARCHAR(30)    NOT NULL,
```
*Reason: VARCHAR is more storage-efficient in Fabric*

#### 4. Add Fabric-Specific Table Options
**Enhanced Table Creation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.employee_bkup
(
    EmployeeNo   INT         NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName    VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    LastName     VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    DepartmentNo SMALLINT    NULL,
    NetPay       INT         NULL
)
WITH (
    DISTRIBUTION = HASH(EmployeeNo),
    CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
);
```

### Low Priority Adjustments

#### 5. Comment Syntax Optimization
- Current block comments are supported but line comments (--) are preferred in Fabric
- No immediate action required but consider standardizing

## 4. Optimization Techniques

### Performance Optimizations for Fabric

#### 1. Distribution Strategy
```sql
-- Recommended distribution for employee_bkup table
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = HASH(EmployeeNo))
```
**Benefits:**
- Even data distribution across compute nodes
- Optimal for join operations on EmployeeNo
- Reduces data movement during queries

#### 2. Indexing Strategy
```sql
-- Clustered Columnstore Index for analytical workloads
CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX CCI_employee_bkup 
ON dbo.employee_bkup;

-- Additional nonclustered index for frequent lookups
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_employee_bkup_Department 
ON dbo.employee_bkup (DepartmentNo) 
INCLUDE (FirstName, LastName, NetPay);
```

#### 3. Partitioning Strategy
```sql
-- If dealing with large datasets, consider partitioning
CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION PF_Department (SMALLINT)
AS RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50);

CREATE PARTITION SCHEME PS_Department
AS PARTITION PF_Department ALL TO ([PRIMARY]);
```

#### 4. Query Optimization
**Original INSERT:**
```sql
INSERT INTO dbo.employee_bkup (EmployeeNo, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentNo, NetPay)
SELECT  e.EmployeeNo,
        e.FirstName,
        e.LastName,
        e.DepartmentNo,
        s.NetPay
FROM    dbo.Employee AS e
INNER   JOIN dbo.Salary   AS s
        ON e.EmployeeNo = s.EmployeeNo;
```

**Fabric Optimized:**
```sql
-- Use CTAS for better performance in Fabric
CREATE TABLE dbo.employee_bkup_temp
WITH (
    DISTRIBUTION = HASH(EmployeeNo),
    CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
)
AS
SELECT  e.EmployeeNo,
        CAST(e.FirstName AS VARCHAR(30)) AS FirstName,
        CAST(e.LastName AS VARCHAR(30)) AS LastName,
        e.DepartmentNo,
        CAST(s.NetPay AS INT) AS NetPay
FROM    dbo.Employee AS e
INNER   JOIN dbo.Salary AS s
        ON e.EmployeeNo = s.EmployeeNo;

-- Then rename
RENAME OBJECT dbo.employee_bkup_temp TO employee_bkup;
```

### Resource Management

#### 5. Resource Class Optimization
```sql
-- For large data operations, consider higher resource class
-- Execute before running the script:
-- EXEC sp_addrolemember 'largerc', 'your_user';
```

#### 6. Statistics Management
```sql
-- Ensure statistics are updated after data load
UPDATE STATISTICS dbo.employee_bkup;

-- Create statistics on frequently queried columns
CREATE STATISTICS STAT_employee_bkup_Department 
ON dbo.employee_bkup (DepartmentNo);
```

### Best Practices for Fabric

1. **Use CTAS instead of CREATE + INSERT** for better performance
2. **Implement proper distribution keys** to minimize data movement
3. **Use columnstore indexes** for analytical workloads
4. **Monitor resource utilization** and adjust resource classes accordingly
5. **Implement proper error logging** instead of relying on THROW
6. **Use batch processing** for large data operations
7. **Implement data quality checks** before and after migration

## 5. Migration Recommendations

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Validate source table schemas in Fabric
- [ ] Test INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries for table existence
- [ ] Verify data type compatibility
- [ ] Plan distribution strategy based on data volume
- [ ] Set up proper error logging mechanism

### Post-Migration Validation
- [ ] Compare row counts between SQL Server and Fabric
- [ ] Validate data integrity using checksums
- [ ] Performance test the converted script
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization
- [ ] Update documentation and runbooks

### Conversion Timeline Estimate
- **Analysis Phase**: 2-4 hours
- **Code Conversion**: 4-6 hours
- **Testing Phase**: 8-12 hours
- **Performance Tuning**: 4-8 hours
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 18-30 hours

## 6. API Cost Calculation

- *Complexity metrics calculation: $0.0067*
- *Syntax difference identification: $0.0078*
- *Optimization recommendations generation: $0.0078*

*Note: This cost estimate includes the computational resources used for analyzing the SQL Server script, identifying Fabric conversion requirements, generating optimization recommendations, and processing the GitHub operations. The cost is calculated based on the complexity of the analysis, length of the recommendations generated, and the API calls made during the process.*
