# SQL Server Documentation - Employee Backup Refresh Script

## 1. Overview of Program

This SQL Server script implements a production-ready routine designed to create and maintain a point-in-time backup of the Employee master dataset. The script serves as a critical component in enterprise data warehousing and analytics infrastructure by ensuring data consistency and providing a reliable backup mechanism for employee information.

**Business Problem Addressed:**
- Provides a reliable backup mechanism for employee master data
- Ensures data consistency during ETL operations
- Maintains referential integrity between Employee and Salary tables
- Supports disaster recovery and data restoration processes

**Enterprise Alignment:**
- Supports enterprise data warehousing by maintaining historical snapshots
- Enables analytics teams to work with consistent datasets
- Provides foundation for reporting and business intelligence operations
- Ensures compliance with data retention policies

**Key SQL Server Components:**
- **Tables**: Primary data storage structures (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup)
- **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulated business logic for backup operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive TRY-CATCH blocks for robust execution
- **DDL Operations**: Dynamic table creation and deletion
- **DML Operations**: Data insertion and selection operations

## 2. Code Structure and Design

The SQL Server script follows a well-structured approach with clear separation of concerns and robust error handling mechanisms.

**Key Components:**

**DDL (Data Definition Language):**
- CREATE TABLE statements for backup table structure
- DROP TABLE operations for cleanup and recreation
- Primary key constraints and data type definitions

**DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
- INSERT statements for data population
- SELECT statements for data retrieval and validation
- Conditional logic for data existence checks

**Joins:**
- INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables
- Ensures referential integrity during backup process

**Functions and System Objects:**
- OBJECT_ID() function for table existence verification
- EXISTS() function for data presence validation
- XACT_STATE() for transaction state management

**Primary SQL Server Components:**
- **Tables**: employee_bkup (backup), Employee (source), Salary (source)
- **Views**: None explicitly defined
- **Stored Procedures**: Embedded procedural logic within script
- **Functions**: System functions for metadata queries
- **CTEs**: None used in this implementation

**Dependencies:**
- Source tables: dbo.Employee, dbo.Salary
- Schema permissions: DDL/DML privileges on dbo schema
- System catalog access for metadata queries

## 3. Data Flow and Processing Logic

**Data Flow Architecture:**

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Set session-level configurations (NOCOUNT ON)
   - Begin error handling context (TRY block)

2. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Check for existing backup table using OBJECT_ID()
   - Drop existing backup table if present

3. **Structure Creation Phase**:
   - Create new backup table with defined schema
   - Establish primary key constraint on EmployeeNo

4. **Data Validation Phase**:
   - Verify existence of source data in Employee table
   - Determine processing path based on data availability

5. **Data Population Phase** (if data exists):
   - Execute INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary tables
   - Insert combined dataset into backup table

6. **Cleanup Phase** (if no data exists):
   - Drop backup table to maintain clean state

**Source and Destination Details:**

**Source Tables:**
- **dbo.Employee**: Contains employee master information
  - Fields: EmployeeNo (INT), FirstName (VARCHAR), LastName (VARCHAR), DepartmentNo (INT)
- **dbo.Salary**: Contains salary information
  - Fields: EmployeeNo (INT), NetPay (DECIMAL)

**Destination Table:**
- **dbo.employee_bkup**: Backup table combining employee and salary data
  - Fields: EmployeeNo (INT), FirstName (CHAR), LastName (CHAR), DepartmentNo (SMALLINT), NetPay (INT)

**Applied Transformations:**
- Data type conversions (VARCHAR to CHAR, DECIMAL to INT)
- Inner join aggregation combining employee and salary information
- Conditional table creation/deletion based on source data availability

## 4. Data Mapping

| Target Table Name | Target Column Name | Source Table Name | Source Column Name | Remarks |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| employee_bkup | EmployeeNo | Employee | EmployeeNo | 1:1 mapping, Primary Key |
| employee_bkup | FirstName | Employee | FirstName | Data type conversion: VARCHAR to CHAR(30) |
| employee_bkup | LastName | Employee | LastName | Data type conversion: VARCHAR to CHAR(30) |
| employee_bkup | DepartmentNo | Employee | DepartmentNo | Data type conversion: INT to SMALLINT |
| employee_bkup | NetPay | Salary | NetPay | Data type conversion: DECIMAL(10,2) to INT, joined via EmployeeNo |

## 5. Complexity Analysis

| Category | Measurement |
|----------|-------------|
| Number of Lines | 95 |
| Tables Used | 3 (Employee, Salary, employee_bkup) |
| Joins | 1 (INNER JOIN between Employee and Salary) |
| Temporary Tables | 0 |
| Aggregate Functions | 0 |
| DML Statements | SELECT: 3, INSERT: 1, CREATE: 2, DROP: 2 |
| Conditional Logic | 2 (IF EXISTS, IF OBJECT_ID) |
| Query Complexity | Low to Medium (1 join, 2 subqueries in EXISTS) |
| Performance Considerations | Optimized with primary key constraints and minimal joins |
| Data Volume Handling | Handles full table refresh, scalable for medium datasets |
| Dependency Complexity | 2 external table dependencies |
| Overall Complexity Score | 35/100 |
